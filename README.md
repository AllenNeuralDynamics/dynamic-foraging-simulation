# Testbed for dynamic foraging models
<font size=3>Here I'm trying to outline  a simple framework that summarizes the dynamic foraging models in the literature (still under developing). I hope this can facilitate our understanding as well as our programming.

To play with the models, please begin with [this Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/hanhou/Dynamic-Foraging/blob/master/Models/Foraging_Testbed.ipynb). [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/hanhou/Dynamic-Foraging/blob/master/Models/Foraging_Testbed.ipynb/master)

I'm new to Python, so please let me know if you find any bugs:)
